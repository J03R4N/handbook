# Units, Teams and Communities

## Units

Your unit is your homebase. Currently, our whole structure is in transformation to become more product- and data-driven. Units like data or people and culture functions as service teams alongside our product teams. Communities form to follow missions apart from our product vision. 

### Engineering

### Data

### Operations

### People & Culture

### Product

### Agile

### Business

## Teams

Our roles at thomann.io are clustered in different units. Each unit provides different roles. They all assembly in product teams, service teams, or communities.

### Product teams

- B2C as customers
- data-driven work
- finding metrics
- focusing on goals

Product teams combine roles from engineering, product, uiux, and agile to own parts of our webshop and app. They use service teams to succeed in their projects.

### Service teams

- engineers and other internal roles as customers
- improve development experience
- support product teams in cross-functionality

Service teams usually have their competency in one unit. Examples are our platform team, operations, data or people & culture. They support our product teams in working end-to-end. 

**Important note:** When service teams grow, we'll add their roles to product teams where it makes sense. This enables more autonomous work within the product teams. 

## Communities

Communities are team members that work on a shared mission. Every team member can join or create a community. They can exist for a long time (e.g. uiux, branding, or poac) or just for a few days or weeks (e.g. to organize a team event). 

### UIUX

This community creates a general look & feel for our customer-facing channels. While ui designers are part of our product teams, it's important that they have a place to sync and work on a shared design system. 

### POAC

This community brings together our product owners and agile coaches. It's a safe space to exchange about team topics and learn from another. This community follows the Vegas rule and currently does not allow lead persons.

### Branding

This community takes care of our employer branding. Cyberpunk style and stickers? All by them.

### CoP Agile

This community talks about agile and the world around it. Even if you're not working with us, you can join and participate. The community meets every 3-4 weeks and usually invites external guests. If you're interested, just email to ralph.cibis@thomann.de.

### BizAdmin

This community takes care of becoming thomann.io.

### Always room for more ideas

Make up your own community! If you have an idea, found a community:

- create a public slack channel (private only, if it's really REALLY necessary)
- send an @channel message in #announcements to inform everyone about your community and its mission
- get started on your mission

**Important note:** make sure that participating in a community doesn't block you in your current role (e.g. engineer in a product team). Be transparent about it and check with your team, if you think the team's performance might decrease.
