# Units, Teams and Communities

## Units

Your unit is your homebase. Currently, our whole structure is in transformation to become more product- and data-driven. Units like data or people and culture functions as service teams alongside our product teams. Communities form to follow missions apart from our product vision.

## Leads

Lead people report directly to our CDO (chief digital officer). The managing director of thomann.io reports to our CDO.

## Teams

Our roles at thomann.io are clustered in different units. Each unit provides different roles. They all assembly in product teams, service teams, or communities.

### Product teams

- B2C as customers
- data-driven work
- finding metrics
- focusing on goals

Product teams combine roles from engineering, product, uiux, and agile to own parts of our webshop and app. They use service teams to succeed in their projects.

### Service teams

- engineers and other internal roles as customers
- improve development experience
- support product teams in cross-functionality

Service teams usually have their competency in one unit. Examples are our platform team, operations, data or people & culture. They support our product teams in working end-to-end. 

**Important note:** When service teams grow, we'll add their roles to product teams where it makes sense. This enables more autonomous work within the product teams. 

## Communities

Communities are team members that work on a shared mission. Every team member can join or create a community. They can exist for a long time (e.g. uiux, branding, or poac) or just for a few days or weeks (e.g. to organize a team event). 

### Strategy Community

This community syncs all lead people with our CDO. It reports on ongoing yearly objectives and makes strategic decisions for thomann.io aligned with objectives from Thomann GmbH. The community meets weekly.

### UIUX

This community creates a general look & feel for our customer-facing channels. While ui designers are part of our product teams, it's important that they have a place to sync and work on a shared design system. 

### POAC

This community brings together our product owners and agile coaches. It's a safe space to exchange about team topics and learn from another. This community follows the Vegas rule and currently does not allow lead persons. The community meets biweekly.

### Branding

This community takes care of our employer branding. Cyberpunk style and stickers? All by them. The community meets biweekly.

### CoP Agile

This community talks about agile and the world around it. Even if you're not working with us, you can join and participate. The community meets every 3-4 weeks and usually invites external guests. If you're interested, just email to ralph.cibis@thomann.de.

### BizAdmin

This community takes care of becoming thomann.io.

### Lead community

This community syncs all lead people twice a week.

### Always room for more ideas

Make up your own community! If you have an idea, found a community:

- create a public slack channel (private only, if it's really REALLY necessary)
- send an @channel message in #announcements to inform everyone about your community and its mission
- add the community to this section of the employee handbook
- get started on your mission

**Important note:** make sure that participating in a community doesn't block you in your current role (e.g. engineer in a product team). Be transparent about it and check with your team, if you think the team's performance might decrease.
