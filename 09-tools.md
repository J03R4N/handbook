# Tools 

## Slack 


Slack is our main communication tool. You can reach every team member of thomann.io via Slack.

### #announcements, #slackcast and #review-1

#announcements is used for must-have/must-know information. For example new employees starting, old ones leaving. Assembly documentation, sign ups for team events... Announcements made should always use the @Channel mention.

#slackcast is used for should-have/should-know/nice-to-have information. For example all-over business context, information on workshops/team events that happened, progress of team projects... Information provided here should either be posted without a mention or only use a weaker form such as mentioning a single team or @hier

Both channels are standard channels every newly added team member joins. If you haven't joined yet, please do so.

#review-1 is used by all teams that have something new to present to everybody. If your team is releasing a new feature or has to show off new development experiences, that’s where you should present. Please use @channel to announce your session, providing a Google Meet link and date/time. 

### #thomann-universe, #tech-talk and #bauchpinselei

#thomann-universe is used to connect all team members and all guests. It has no real communication purpose other than being able to contact all people we have in our slack workspace, regardless if the belong to the workspace or are guests.

Use the #tech-talk channel if you stumbled upon interesting news in tech that team members could be interested in.

If you find a really positive customer feedback, provide it to everybody in #bauchpinselei.

Do not use @channel or @hier mentions in these three channels.

### #opsteam-support and #datateam-support

Any questions regarding our infrastructure or how to track data and receive it? Both channels help you to quickly connect with team members of our operations and of our data team. Remember: there are no stupid questions. If you’re asking yourself a question, chances are high someone else can also profit from an answer.

If your question is urgent, you can use the @datateam and @opsteam mentions.
