## How to contribute to this handbook

This handbook is maintained by Thomann.io employees.

It's entirely written in Markdown for the sake of simplicity and portability. If you want to learn more about Markdown, check [John Gruber's excellent documentation](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). 

If you spot typos, find something to be unclear or simply wrong, there are two options:

- [File an issue](https://github.com/cookiefactory/handbook/issues/new)
- Change the Markdown file directly - a video follows

### Where goes what?

- All files go in assets
- Stay plain text when possible
- test
